# NIGERIA FOOD PRICES

This is the data wrangling phase of the Nigeria food prices dashboard. Here, I merged 4 years worth of data for all states of the federation from different sheets and workbooks into one csv file: One concise csv for all states and all available food data over the period. ```state_food_prices.csv```

This is the first analysis in my yet to be launched project for data visualization

``` I really need support to get the project up and running```
In the mean time, I will continue to contribute about 10% of my productive time to it.
