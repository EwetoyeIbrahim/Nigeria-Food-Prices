# NIGERIA FOOD PRICES

This is the data wrangling phase of the Nigeria food prices dashboard. Here, I merged 3 years worth of data for all states of the federation from different sheets and workbooks into two csv files:
1. one concise csv for all states and all available food data over the period. ```state_food_prices.csv```
2. the national average of all available foods. Though this won't be used for the dashboard, yet to be published, but may be useful for someone else. ```Price of Food 2016_2019.csv```

This is the first analysis of my yet to be launched project for data visualization

``` I really need support to get the project up and running```
in the mean time, I will continue to contribute about 4% of my productive timr to it.
